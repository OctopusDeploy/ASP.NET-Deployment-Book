# Introduction

This chapter will provide a quick summary of . It's not going to be anywhere near a complete guide; it's just a summary to make some of the terms familiar, and will reference other docs/books/presentations for people to learn more. 

It will first explain the outline of the book. We start with what ASP.NET 5.0 is and some of the changes. Then we talk about what ASP.NET 5.0 applications look like in production. Then we talk about the journey to get "from A (dev) to B (prod)", with a focus on CI tooling and Octopus. 

The ASP.NET 5.0 summary will start with DNX, .NET Core, cross-platform, and some of the key architectural changes. It will then go into detail about a few things that affect production deployments. 

 - The new project model (no MSBuild)
 - Dynamic compilation with Roslyn at development time
 - Application configuration (appsettings.json)
 - OWIN, Kestrel, etc.
