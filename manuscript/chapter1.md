## Introduction

This chapter will provide a quick summary of ASP.NET 5.0, DNX, .NET Core, cross-platform, and some of the key architectural changes. It's not going to be anywhere near a complete guide; it's just a summary to make some of the terms familiar, and will reference other docs/books/presentations for people to learn more. 

It will explain some key changes that affect production deployments, like:

 - The new project model (no MSBuild)
 - Dynamic compilation with Roslyn at development time
 - Application configuration (appsettings.json)
 - OWIN, Kestrel, etc.
